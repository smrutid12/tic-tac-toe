![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19062d6a-2c2a-4886-856e-7a299f56be1f)

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Next.js, a React framework for server-rendered applications.

## Features

- Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game🎮
- Responsive design
- Modern Next.js features static site generation

## Prerequisites
- npm or yarn

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository😁:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-tic-tac-toe.git](https://github.com/smrutid12/tic-tac-toe.git)
2. **Install npm/yarn⬇️**
   npm install or yarn
3. **Run project 🚀**
   npm run dev or yarn start

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Now enjoy the game 😉.
Winner 💪: Play to find out!
